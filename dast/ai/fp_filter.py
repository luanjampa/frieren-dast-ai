"""
Deterministic false-positive filter — runs BEFORE the LLM validator.

Rules are cheap, fast, and always correct. They handle well-known cases
where the scanner pattern fires but exploitation is structurally impossible.
If a rule matches, the finding is discarded immediately without any LLM call.

Adding a new rule: add a function _fp_<name>(finding, target) -> Optional[str]
that returns a reason string when the finding is a FP, None otherwise, then
register it in _RULES.
