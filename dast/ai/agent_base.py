"""
Base class for all specialized vulnerability agents.

Each agent targets a single vulnerability class, embeds its own
LLM system prompt, and returns structured AgentFinding objects.
Agents that find deterministic evidence (e.g. secret patterns) can
set bypass_validation=True to skip the LLM exploit-validator step.

Safety policy — all agents MUST follow:
  - Time-based blind payloads (SLEEP, WAITFOR) allowed with max 5s delay
  - No destructive SQL (DROP, TRUNCATE, DELETE without WHERE)
  - No OS commands that write, delete, or modify files
  - No payloads that exhaust CPU/memory/connections
  - Detection only: observe server behaviour, never modify application state
