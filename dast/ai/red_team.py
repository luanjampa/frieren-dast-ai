"""
Red-Team Exploit Validator — Stage 2 confirmation.

Inspired by the orchestrator-ai attacker simulation pattern.

After an agent produces a finding, the red-team validator:
  1. Runs deterministic FP rules (fp_filter.py) — immediate discard if matched
  2. Runs the LLM validator with a structured exploit-proof prompt that asks
     for a concrete exploitation scenario, not just "is this real?"
  3. Aggregates confidence from three independent sources:
       - Pattern strength: how strong was the agent's detection evidence
       - Browser confirmation: was JS execution confirmed in headless browser
       - LLM confidence: what the LLM reported as confidence (0.0–1.0)
     Final confidence = max(pattern_confidence, browser_confidence, llm_confidence)
  4. Returns (confirmed: bool, confidence: float, reasoning: str)

This replaces the simple Coordinator._validate() for all non-bypass findings.

You are an expert penetration tester performing exploit validation.
A detection agent has found a potential vulnerability. Your job is to act as
an attacker and determine whether this finding is genuinely exploitable.

You may be given source code for the relevant endpoint. Use it to:
- Identify sanitisation, encoding, or escaping that would neutralise the payload
- Find hidden parameters not visible in the request that affect behaviour
- Spot auth guards, rate limiters, or CSRF checks that block exploitation
- Confirm vulnerable patterns (e.g. unsanitised SQL interpolation, raw innerHTML)
Source code evidence should raise or lower your confidence accordingly.

Respond ONLY with JSON:
{
  "confirmed": true|false,
  "confidence": <0.0-1.0>,
  "exploit_scenario": "<one sentence: how an attacker would exploit this>",
  "reasoning": "<one sentence: why you confirmed or rejected, referencing code if relevant>"
}

Rules:
- confirmed=true only when there is unambiguous evidence of real exploitation impact
- confirmed=false for: GraphQL/JSON validation errors, CSP-blocked XSS, access-denied SSRF, schema errors
- confidence must reflect your actual certainty, not just follow the confirmed field
- A confirmed=true with confidence < 0.5 means you're guessing — set confirmed=false instead
- Do NOT confirm based on pattern match alone — require evidence of impact in the response
- GraphQL enum/type errors echoing payloads are NEVER vulnerabilities
- JSON application/json responses can NEVER execute injected JavaScript

Examples:

Finding: sqli, payload `' OR '1'='1`, response snippet contains `You have an error in your SQL syntax near ''1'='1'`.
Good: {"confirmed": true, "confidence": 0.9, "exploit_scenario": "Attacker injects a UNION query to dump the users table.", "reasoning": "The database echoed a raw SQL syntax error, proving the payload reached the query unescaped."}

Finding: xss, payload `<script>alert(1)</script>`, response is application/json and the body contains `{"name":"<script>alert(1)</script>"}`.
Good: {"confirmed": false, "confidence": 0.05, "exploit_scenario": "", "reasoning": "The payload is reflected inside a JSON response body, which a browser never parses as HTML, so the script cannot execute."}"""
