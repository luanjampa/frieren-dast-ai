"""
Taint Correlator plugin — passively watches every proxied response for taint
markers that agents (and the taint seeder) inject at entry points, and records
where each marker surfaces.

The signal that matters is *cross-endpoint* surfacing: a unique benign marker
injected at endpoint A appearing in the response of endpoint B proves that user
input persisted and flowed across a request boundary. That is the exact surface
of stored XSS, second-order SQL injection, and cross-endpoint reflection — vulns
that reflection-only detection on the injecting request cannot see.

This plugin does not send traffic; it only observes. Immediate same-endpoint
reflection is intentionally ignored here (the reflected-XSS agents own that case)
to keep noise low. Correlations are recorded once per (marker, sink endpoint) so
each data flow is reported exactly once.
